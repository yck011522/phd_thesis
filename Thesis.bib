  abstract = {Platforms that integrate developments from multiple disciplines are becoming increasingly relevant as the complexity of different technologies increases day by day. In this context, this paper describes an integrative approach for the development of architectural projects. It portrays the benefits of applying such approach by describing its implementation throughout the development and execution of a building demonstrator. Through increasing the agility and extending the scope of existing computational tools, multiple collaborators were empowered to generate innovative solutions across the different phases of the project´s cycle. For this purpose, novel solutions for planar segmented wood shells are showcased at different levels. First, it is demonstrated how the application of a sophisticated hollow-cassette building system allowed the optimization of material use, production time and mounting logistics due to the modulation of the parameters of each construction element. Second, the paper discusses how the articulation of that complexity was crucial when negotiating between multiple professions, interacting with different contractors and complying with the corresponding norms. Finally, the innovative architectural features of the resulting building are described, and the accomplishments are benchmarked through comparison with typological predecessor.},

The structure is an irregular, funnel-shaped reciprocal frame resting on a central concrete column, and has been fabricated using a robot-based assembly process. The project addresses several known design and fabrication challenges: modelling of free-form reciprocal frames, complex interrelations between their geometry and structural behaviour, as well as develops custom software tools to represent different models and interface design and structural analysis environments. The performance-driven design is exemplified by studies on the relationship between geometric parameters of the reciprocal frame and the resulting force-flow and flexural stiffness of the structure. The final design is obtained by differentiating geometry and stiffness to reduce deflection and tensile stresses while observing fabrication constraints.The project demonstrates the application of computational design to create customized, performance-driven and robotically fabricated structures, and its successful realization validates the methods under real-life planning and construction conditions.},

This paper proposes to apply Reinforcement Learning to control robot movements in contact-rich and tolerance-prone assembly tasks and presents the first successful demonstration of this approach in the context of architectural construction. Exemplified by assembly of lap joints for custom timber frames, robot movements are guided by force/torque and pose data to insert a timber element in its mating counterpart(s). Using an adapted Ape-X DDPG algorithm, the control policy is trained entirely in simulation and successfully deployed in reality. The experiments show the policy can also generalize to situations in real world not seen in training, such as tolerances and shape variations. This caters to uncertainties occurring in construction processes and facilitates fabrication of differentiated, customized designs.},

Therefore, rigid body dynamic models become obsolete and the need for new dynamic models accounting for the flexibility of industrial manipulators emerges. To this end, a physics-based approach considering the flexibility of robots’ links and gearboxes is presented. In particular, this paper intends to provide a framework for modelling flexible robotic structures’ towards increasing their accuracy. The robot components’ elasticity is introduced in a lumped parameters model by pairs of springs and dampers, the number of which is affected by the target of keeping the computational effort and run time of the simulation at levels allowing for the integration of the model in industrial environments. Finally, the proposed model considers the activation of the robots’ Digital Twins aiming to enable the use of the model in a series of applications e.g. predictive maintenance, energy efficiency optimization etc.},

Over a period of a number of years several revisions and additions took place, as it was used as the handout workshop manual for Fox Maple Timber Framing Workshops. At last, it was published for general distribution in 1998. {$<$}P{$>$}When this book was first published in 1998, scientific testing results for pegged mortise and tenon joinery simply did not exist. The corollaries that could be made at that time were drawn from testing results for bolted connections. This is common in engineering as the essential physical laws concerning force and motion, primarily Newtonian physics, are symmetrical. However, nothing ever beats a direct test for a specific condition as the results end with an emphatic exclamation point. In the past five or six years testing has at last been carried out for a number of the most common pegged joinery conditions and the results have been published. The impetus for this revision was in large part to update and to include these new testing results so that the readers would be privy to the latest engineering results available for timber frame joinery. {$<$}P{$>$}Along the way, over 150 new photos and drawings were added and editorial additions were made to clarify specific conditions, or to more fully explain a critical aspect of timber framing. While the essential book is the same, virtually every element is expanded in some way to paint a more vibrant picture of the technical aspects of how to build a traditional timber frame. In addition, there is an expanded element of color and nuance to help the reader more fully understand the magic of timber framing... and that timber framing really is the Jazz of building. {$<$}P{$>$}Illustrated with over 500 photos and CAD drawings.},

The combination provides the analyst with the ability to calculate probability levels for output variables with speed and accuracy over the full range of probability levels. Application is made to a space propulsion system turbine blade for which the geometry and material properties are treated as random variables.

  abstract = {Self-supporting structures are prominent in historical and contemporary architecture due to advantageous structural properties and efficient use of material. Computer graphics research has recently contributed new design tools that allow creating and interactively exploring self-supporting freeform designs. However, the physical construction of such freeform structures remains challenging, even on small scales. Current construction processes require extensive formwork during assembly, which quickly leads to prohibitively high construction costs for realizations on a building scale. This greatly limits the practical impact of the existing freeform design tools. We propose to replace the commonly used dense formwork with a sparse set of temporary chains. Our method enables gradual construction of the masonry model in stable sections and drastically reduces the material requirements and construction costs. We analyze the input using a variational method to find stable sections, and devise a computationally tractable divide-and-conquer strategy for the combinatorial problem of finding an optimal construction sequence. We validate our method on 3D printed models, demonstrate an application to the restoration of historical models, and create designs of recreational, collaborative self-supporting puzzles.},

  abstract = {The emergence of large-scale freeform shapes in architecture poses big challenges to the fabrication of such structures. A key problem is the approximation of the design surface by a union of patches, so-called panels, that can be manufactured with a selected technology at reasonable cost, while meeting the design intent and achieving the desired aesthetic quality of panel layout and surface smoothness. The production of curved panels is mostly based on molds. Since the cost of mold fabrication often dominates the panel cost, there is strong incentive to use the same mold for multiple panels. We cast the major practical requirements for architectural surface paneling, including mold reuse, into a global optimization framework that interleaves discrete and continuous optimization steps to minimize production cost while meeting user-specified quality constraints. The search space for optimization is mainly generated through controlled deviation from the design surface and tolerances on positional and normal continuity between neighboring panels. A novel 6-dimensional metric space allows us to quickly compute approximate inter-panel distances, which dramatically improves the performance of the optimization and enables the handling of complex arrangements with thousands of panels. The practical relevance of our system is demonstrated by paneling solutions for real, cutting-edge architectural freeform design projects.},

Consequently, these methods have been extended further away from basic robot planning into further difficult scenarios and diverse applications. A comprehensive survey of the growing body of work in sampling-based planning is given here. Simulations are executed to evaluate some of the proposed planners and highlight some of the implementation details that are often left unspecified. An emphasis is placed on contemporary research directions in this field. We address planners that tackle current issues in robotics. For instance, real-life kinodynamic planning, optimal planning, replanning in dynamic environments, and planning under uncertainty are discussed. The aim of this paper is to survey the state of the art in motion planning and to assess selected planners, examine implementation details and above all shed a light on the current challenges in motion planning and the promising approaches that will potentially overcome those problems.},

The compressive strength of the single-glued joints (where only the surfaces of the tenon were glued) and double-glued joints (where the surfaces of both the mortise and tenon elements were glued) for various joint fit categories was also determined. It was found that despite the huge number of produced test specimens and their measurements, the joint fits could be maintained with the milling machine and tools. The thickness of the joint could be characterized by measuring the data at the centre of the tenon, whereas the gap width of the mortise could be characterized by measuring the data on the side of the tool leaving the wood. The double-glued joints showed higher breaking force and displacement values as compared to the single-glued joints. The joints were found to be the strongest at a tight fit of 0.1~mm.},

  abstract = {Despite modern timber construction being on the forefront of digital technology in construction, subtractive CNC—fabrication technologies are still predominantly used in the industry. An important break in the digital chain occurs when prefabricated small building parts have to be assembled manually into functional modules. This can result in a loss of digital information in the process. Therefore, a robotic setup for timber construction was specifically developed by the authors enabling large-scale spatial fabrication possibilities using a combination of subtractive external tools for cutting and drilling and additive robotic operations. Through automatization techniques and innovative feedback processes, the system can minimize material waste by reacting to different material sizes even during the construction process. In a case study, which was undertaken in the course of the Master of Advanced Studies program in Digital Fabrication at ETH Zurich, a complete digital workflow using additive robotic fabrication processes in timber construction was realized. We demonstrate the conception of the worldwide first double-story robotically assembled timber structure, explain its fabrication processes including an integrated envelope, and conclude by analyzing the robotic fabrication technologies in terms of their efficiency and structural and functional capabilities and limits.},

Even so, there is no consensus definition of the term 'CST' in HCI, and in most studies, CSTs have been construed as one-off exploratory prototypes, typically built by the researchers themselves. This makes it difficult to clearly demarcate CST research, but also to compare findings across studies, which impedes advancement in digital creativity as a growing field of research. Based on a literature review of 143 papers from the ACM Digital Library (1999-2018), we contribute a first overview of the key characteristics of CSTs developed by the HCI community. Moreover, we propose a tentative definition of a CST to help strengthen knowledge sharing across CST studies. We end by discussing our study's implications for future HCI research on CSTs and digital creativity.},

  abstract = {Traditional wood-wood connections, widely used in the past, have been progressively replaced by steel fasteners and bonding processes in modern timber constructions. However, the emergence of digital fabrication and innovative engineered timber products have offered new design possibilities for wood-wood connections. The design-to-production workflow has evolved considerably over the last few decades, such that a large number of connections with various geometries can now be easily produced. These connections have become a cost-competitive alternative for the edgewise connection of thin timber panels. Several challenges remain in order to broaden the use of this specific joining technique into common timber construction practice: (1) prove the applicability at the building scale, (2) propose a standardized construction system, (3) develop a convenient calculation model for practice, and (4) investigate the mechanical behavior of wood-wood connections. The first building implementation of digitally produced through-tenon connections for a folded-plate structure is presented in this work. Specific computational tools for the design and manufacture of more than 300 different plates were efficiently applied in a multi-stakeholder project environment. Cross-laminated timber panels were investigated for the first time, and the potential of such connections was demonstrated for different engineered timber products. Moreover, this work demonstrated the feasibility of this construction system at the building scale. For a more resilient and locally distributed construction process, a standardized system using through-tenon connections and commonly available small panels was developed to reconstitute basic housing components. Based on a case-study with industry partners, the fabrication and assembly processes were validated with prototypes made of oriented strand board. Their structural performance was investigated by means of a numerical model and a comparison with glued and nailed assemblies. The results showed that through-tenon connections are a viable alternative to commonly used mechanical fasteners. So far, the structural analysis of such construction systems has been mainly achieved with complex finite element models, not in line with the simplicity of basic housing elements. A convenient calculation model for practice, which can capture the semi-rigid behavior of the connections and predict the effective bending stiffness, was thus introduced and subjected to large-scale bending tests. The proposed model was in good agreement with the experimental results, highlighting the importance of the connection behavior.  The in-plane behavior of through-tenon connections for several timber panel materials was characterized through an experimental campaign to determine the load-carrying capacity and slip modulus required for calculation models. Based on the test results, existing guidelines were evaluated to safely apply these connections in structural elements while a finite element model was developed to approximate their performance. This work constitutes a firm basis for the optimization of design guidelines and the creation of an extensive database on digitally produced wood-wood connections. Finally, this thesis provides a convenient design framework for the newly developed standardized timber construction system and a solid foundation for research into digitally produced wood-wood connections},

First, we propose an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries (in size and number of bits) following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions. In the process, we derive the maximum theoretical inter-marker distance that dictionaries of square binary markers can have. Second, a method for automatically detecting the markers and correcting possible errors is proposed. Third, a solution to the occlusion problem in augmented reality applications is shown. To that aim, multiple markers are combined with an occlusion mask calculated by color segmentation. The experiments conducted show that our proposal obtains dictionaries with higher inter-marker distances and lower false negative rates than state-of-the-art systems, and provides an effective solution to the occlusion problem.},

  abstract = {As the connection between data and building materials grows ever closer, with digital information not just informing plans but actually being used to create the material that will construct a building―robots are necessarily playing a large role in architecture. Yet the use of robots in architecture has not been treated comprehensively until now. The Robotic Touch features thirty research projects on robots in architecture originating at ETH Zurich, documenting various methods and concepts relating to the use of robots in architecture. In particular, The Robotic Touch offers the first full analysis of the material and constructive aspects of robot-based building projects―and draws out the implications for architectural design on the growing use of robots. The volume is rounded out by six topical essays on broader aspects of the subject, along with technical data-sheets and a helpful glossary.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the allocation of part tolerances is a highly responsible task due to the complex repercussions on both product quality and cost. As a consequence, since its beginnings in the 1960s, least-cost tolerance allocation using optimization techniques, i.e. tolerance-cost optimization, was continuously in focus of numerous research activities. Nowadays, increasing cost and quality pressure, availability of real manufacturing data driven by Industry 4.0 technologies, and rising computational power result in a continuously growing interest in tolerance-cost optimization in both research and industry. However, inconsistent terminology and the lack of a classification of the various relevant aspects is an obstacle for the application of tolerance-cost optimization approaches. There is no literature comprehensively and clearly summarizing the current state of the art and illustrating the relevant key aspects. Motivated to overcome this drawback, this article provides a comprehensive as well as detailed overview of the broad research field in tolerance-cost optimization for both beginners and experts. To facilitate the first steps for readers who are less familiar with the topic, the paper initially outlines the fundamentals of tolerance-cost optimization including its basic idea, elementary terminology and mathematical formulation. These fundamentals serve as a basis for a subsequent detailed discussion of the key elements with focus on the different characteristics concerning the optimization problem, tolerance-cost model, technical system model and the tolerance analysis model. These aspects are gathered and summarized in a structured mind map, which equips the reader with a comprehensive graphical overview of all the various facets and aspects of tolerance-cost optimization. Beside this, the paper gives a retrospect of the past fifty years of research in tolerance cost-optimization, considering 290 relevant publications. Based thereon, current issues and future research needs in tolerance-cost optimization were identified.},

The precise spatial positioning of wooden components represents the possibility of an innovative industrial procedure with a high degree of building precision, which can be manufactured without additional formwork or supports. Gluing is the main connection technology for the construction system because it can be fully integrated into a robotic fabrication process. The new status of research in the area of digital fabrication of complex timber structures is limited mainly to the improvement in geometry and mechanical processing of components. The fundamental element of the constructive system is the expanded node. Regarding fabrication and assembly of nodes, the complexity increases with the number of bars meeting at one point. The proposed geometric expansion of the node reduces the complexity and allows a simple sequential joining process.},

The force-locking capacity of the connections is utilised to support the robotic assembly of five unique timber frame modules of 5.5 by 2.2 by 2.5 metres, each with a unique timber lattice pattern. For each major joint typology we conduct a series of structural load-tests to evaluate the structural performance. We develop a custom software to enable architects and engineers to interactively design with those principles, taking into account both structural and production feasibility constraints. As a demonstration of our design approach, the five modules were robotically assembled using the described methods.},

  abstract = {Frame shapes, which are made of struts, have been widely used in many fields, such as art, sculpture, architecture, and geometric modeling, etc. An interest in robotic fabrication of frame shapes via spatial thermoplastic extrusion has been increasingly growing in recent years. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to generate a feasible fabrication sequence for general frame shapes. To solve this non-trivial combinatorial problem, we develop a divide-andconquer strategy that first decomposes the input frame shape into stable layers via a constrained sparse optimization model. Then we search a feasible sequence for each layer via a local optimization method together with a backtracking strategy. The generated sequence guarantees that the already-printed part is in a stable equilibrium state at all stages of fabrication, and that the 3D printing extrusion head does not collide with the printed part during the fabrication. Our algorithm has been validated by a built prototype robotic fabrication system made by a 6-axis KUKA robotic arm with a customized extrusion head. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our algorithm.},

This article describes the process of converting an off-the-shelf construction machine into an autonomous robotic system. First we outline the necessary sensing equipment for full autonomy and the novel actuation of the legs, and compare three different complementary actuation principles for the excavator's arm. Second, we solve the state estimation problem for a general wheeled-legged robot. Beside kinematic measurements, it includes GNSS-RTK, to absolutely reference the machine on a construction site. Third, we developed individual controllers for driving, chassis balancing and arm motions allowing for fully autonomous operation. Lastly, we highlight the machine's potential in four different real-world applications, e.g. autonomous trench digging, autonomous assembly of dry stone walls, autonomous forestry work and semi-autonomous teleoperation. On top, we also share some development insights and possible future research directions.},

  abstract = {As a result of the natural growing process of wood, each timber lamella shows a high variability in its mechanical properties, particularly strength and stiffness. It is assumed that those properties are governed by a random process and, subsequently, that the effective stiffness of glued laminated timber also varies randomly. Therefore, a probabilistic approach is necessary. Hence, the latest achievements in probabilistic timber engineering are reviewed and compared. Numerous works rely on random process models for the representation of stiffness and/or strength distributions in single timber lamellas. The statistical evaluation of those random process models, however, is limited almost exclusively to Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) so far. Therefore, this work aims at giving an overview of alternative ways to compute the effective stiffness, by reviewing the framework of stochastic finite element methods. Random process models for the representation of the stiffness distribution in single lamellas are discussed, and the two most promising alternatives to the MCS for computation of effective stiffness parameters, the perturbation and the spectral stochastic finite element method, are evaluated in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Finally, this paper shows alternative and more efficient ways of exploring the stochastic nature of wood, delivering a new basis for more reliable design concepts for timber products.},

  abstract = {The present paper contains a proposal for the probabilistic modeling of timber material properties. It is produced in the context of the Probabilistic Model Code (PMC) of the Joint Committee on Structural Safety (JCSS) [Joint Committee of Structural Safety. Probabilistic Model Code, Internet Publication: www.jcss.ethz.ch; 2001] and of the COST action E24 ‘Reliability of Timber Structures’ [COST Action E 24, Reliability of timber structures. Several meetings and Publications, Internet Publication: http://www.km.fgg.uni-lj.si/coste24/coste24.htm; 2005]. The present proposal is based on discussions and comments from participants of the COST E24 action and the members of the JCSS. The paper contains a description of the basic reference properties for timber strength parameters and ultimate limit state equations for timber components. The recommended probabilistic model for these basic properties is presented and possible refinements are given related to updating of the probabilistic model given new information, modeling of the spatial variation of strength properties and the duration of load effects.},

Our system facilitates the creation of custom joints by a modeling interface combined with computer numerical control (CNC) fabrication. The design space is a 3D grid of voxels that enables efficient geometrical analysis and combinatorial search. The interface has two modes: manual editing and gallery. In the manual editing mode, the user edits a joint while receiving real-time graphical feedback and suggestions provided based on performance metrics including slidability, fabricability, and durability with regard to the direction of fiber. In the gallery mode, the user views and selects feasible joints that have been pre-calculated. When a joint design is finalized, it can be manufactured with a 3-axis CNC milling machine using a specialized path planning algorithm that ensures joint assemblability by corner rounding. This system was evaluated via a user study and by designing and fabricating joint samples and functional furniture.},

  abstract = {This research focuses on a long-standing, yet critical problem in the erection of steel structures. In the current state of practice, steel workers must stand on an unfinished structure to assist with the assembly of structural elements manually. They must pull on the wire hanging under the rigging elements to align the bolting holes of the moving and fixed elements. This work is often performed in high places, which can be very risky. Therefore, we have developed a robotic assembly system (RAS) for steel beam erection and assembly to prevent workers from having to work in a high place. The RAS consists of four methods: rotation, alignment, bolting, and unloading. The rotation method involves a flywheel installed on top of the rigging beam, which aims to rotate the beam to the assembly angle. The alignment method includes both vertical and horizontal alignment. The vertical alignment relies on a camera and a marker on the column to align the beam altitude. The horizontal alignment relies on a specially-designed beam, which allows for it to be smoothly guided into the right position. The bolting method is used to connect the beam to a fixed element. We designed an additional guide hole above each bolt hole. The bolt can be inserted in the guide hole and slid to the bolt hole. The unloading method is used to unload the crane cable and the RAS. We use a pin mechanism for the beam-hook connection so it can easily be unplugged by a motor. The system is built in a scaled experimental construction site to validate its feasibility. The results show that the RAS can operate the assembly process without humans working at risky heights, and can complete faster than the traditional method. In conclusion, we have developed a robotics assembly system that can help reduce the frequency of accidental falls during the steel beam assembly process. The RAS adheres to the process of the current erection method and can be broadly introduced to existing construction sites.},

The operator's commands are smoothened online by a trajectory generator accounting for input and state constraints. The resulting optimal control problem is solved using the model predictive control approach.

Whereas their fabrication has been automated using computer-aided design programming, research focused on the development of automated numerical tools for their structural analysis has been very limited. This paper presents a method to automate the generation of a finite element model for the analysis of structures with a large number of joints. The model is developed taking the example of recently developed double-layered timber plate shells. Vertical displacements obtained with the semi-rigid spring model proposed are in good agreement with experimental tests performed on small-scale prototypes, whereas rigid modelling of the connections highly underestimates displacements of the structure. Semi-rigidity of the connections in translation as well as in rotation was shown to highly influence the model. The generation of the numerical model was successfully automated for large-scale structures.},

  abstract = {Timber plate structures with integral mechanical attachments have been successfully built in the last decades. Previous research has highlighted the influence of these connections in the global behavior of the structures. Double-layered plate shells are one of the latest applications of integral joints. Their fabrication and assembly has been proven efficient. However, their structural behavior remains unknown. Simplified models are required to predict their behavior since an individual detailed modelling of the large amount of joints would be time-consuming and computationally expensive. Current simplifications involve either considering the connections as rigid or hinged and do not allow accurate prediction of their behavior. In this paper, a numerical finite element model in which the semi-rigid behavior of the joints is modeled by means of springs is presented for a double-layered timber plate structure made of 5 by 3 segments. The numerical model is automatically generated in the finite element software AbaqusTM from a simplified geometry. Numerical results are compared to a three-point bending test performed on two specimens. The developed spring model shows promising results for its application to a full double-layered timber plate shell. Only axial and shear stiffnesses were implemented in this model while the other degrees of freedom were considered rigid. This consideration might lead to an overly stiff model},

  abstract = {Geometry lies at the core of the architectural design process. It is omnipresent, from the initial form-finding stages to the actual construction. Modern constructive geometry provides a variety of tools for the efficient design, analysis, and manufacture of complex shapes. This results in new challenges for architecture. However, the architectural application also poses new problems to geometry. Architectural geometry is therefore an entire research area, currently emerging at the border between applied geometry and architecture. This book has been written as a textbook for students of architecture or industrial design. It comprises material at all levels, from the basics of geometric modeling to the cutting edge of research. During the architectural journey through geometry, topics typically reserved for a mathematically well-trained audience are addressed in an easily understandable way. These include central concepts on freeform curves and surfaces, differential geometry, kinematic geometry, mesh processing, digital reconstruction, and optimization of shapes. This book is also intended as a geometry consultant for architects, construction engineers, and industrial designers and as a source of inspiration for scientists interested in applications of geometry processing in architecture and art.},

  abstract = {Design is "something that we do" that is related to our unique human condition as creative individuals, so as "making" is related to how we manifest and impress that uniqueness into our surrounding environment. Nonetheless, the use of technology in architectural design, by being focused mainly on the representation -both digital and physical - of a pre-determined idea, has neglected using digital tools in a more exploratory way by integrating body and senses in the design processes. As physical modeling, gestures, and tools are mechanisms by which designers learn and think, I assert that creativity emerges in the very moment of impression of the self onto the material world as an improvised choreography between humans and objects -materials and tools- by using body gestures neither as action nor perception, but as the unity of both. If we are to extend our creativity and enhance the design experience through the use of digital tools, we need to reformulate the way we interact with computers and fabrication machines, by developing new models and strategies focused on the integration between both. In this thesis, I propose an alternative way for designers to use digital tools, transcending from a model of 'operation' to a model of 'interaction'. My hypothesis is that real-time interaction between designers and fabrication machines can augment our creativity and cognition engaging exploration, speculation and improvisation of designs through the use of gestures and interactive computation. I propose a model of interaction that seeks to transcend the 'hylomorphic' model imperative in today's architectural design practice to a more reciprocal form of computational making. To do so, I propose the Making Gestures project, which explores real-time interaction between mind, body, and tools by using body gestures and imbuing fabrication machines with behavior in order to establish a dialog, which embraces ambiguity and the unexpected to engage the designer into insightful design processes.},

  abstract = {Chinese heritage timber buildings are of high historical and cultural values. The column footing joint is an important connection influencing the structural performance under dynamic load. The moment-rotation relationship of a column footing joint is studied and the effects of vertical load and ratio of column height to diameter on its rotational behavior are analyzed. A spring elements model is proposed to simulate the column footing joint and its stiffness matrix can be simplified to include only one stiffness parameter with some assumptions. A component-based finite-element model of a timber pavilion is then developed to investigate the effect of rotational stiffness on the structural dynamic characteristics. Results show that a heavier vertical load may lead to larger ultimate moment capacity of the joint. The initial rotational stiffness and ultimate moment capacity decrease with increasing column height to diameter ratio. The modal frequency of the structure studied changes remarkably when the rotational stiffness varies from 104 to 108 N▪m/rad. The column footing joints should be regarded as semirigid connections in the structural dynamic analysis. A field experiment was also conducted to further demonstrate that the rotational stiffness of column footing joint has notable influence on the dynamic characteristics of traditional Chinese timber structure.},

This report begins with a summary of the probabilistic basis of Eurocodes, analyses the strength distributions of wooden materials, demonstrates the effects of different distribution functions on the calculated safety level and shows some results of the applications of reliability analysis. When the number of experiments allows, determination of the 5\% fractile of strength should be based on the function fitting on the lower tail of the strength values, for instance 10\%. All smooth functions fitted to tail data gave good estimates of the 5\% fractile. When the 5\% fractile was determined from a function fitted to all data, up to 5\% error occurred (in one case 9\%) when compared to a non-parametric estimate. Three-parameter Weibull distribution gave, in all calculated cases, the 5\% fractile within an accuracy of ±3\%. The result of structural reliability analysis depends strongly on the load and strength distribution types used. When fitted functions are used in reliability analysis, it is essential that the fit is good in the lower tail area, the lowest values being most important. When fitted to the same data, a two-parametric Weibull distribution gives the most pessimistic prediction for the tail, with a normal distribution being next, and lognormal and three-parameter Weibull being the most optimistic. In an example, a two-parameter Weibull gave a failure probability 10 times higher than that of a three-parameter Weibull. The analysis suggests that gM = 1.2 to 1.3 is reasonable for timber structures when gG = 1.2 and gQ = 1.5.},

The algorithm is designed to take the CAD 3D geometry of an IATP structure as input and automates the construction and analysis of the corresponding CAE model using a macroscopic element, which is an alternative to continuum Finite Element (FE) models. Each component of the macro model is assigned a unique tag that is linked to the relevant geometric and structural parameters. The CAE model integrity is maintained through the use of the common data model (CDM) concept and object-oriented programming. The relevant algorithms are implemented in Rhinoceros 3D using RhinoCommon, a .NET software development kit. Once the CAE macro model is generated, it is introduced to the OpenSees computational platform for structural analysis. The algorithmic framework is demonstrated using two case structures: a prefabricated timber beam with standard geometry and a free-form timber plate arch. The results are verified with measurements from physical experiments and FE models, where the time needed to convert thousands of CAD assemblies to the corresponding CAE models for response simulation is considerably reduced.},

  abstract = {Spurred by the recent advancements in Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Integral Mechanical Attachment (IMA) technique has been resurrected. Using IMAs, connections between timber elements are established through their form, instead of using additional connectors. In light of this, a new design framework has been proposed to construct Integrally-Attached Timber Plate (IATP) structures. Despite the recent developments in architectural geometry processing and digital fabrication, there have been very few systematic investigations of the mechanical characteristics of IATPs. As such, the current dissertation is centered around: (i) experimental studies, (ii) introduction of macroscopic model, and (iii) introduction of CAD-to-CAE data exchange framework.  Physical experiments are first conducted to understand the behavior of Through-Tenon joints under tensile, edgewise, and flatwise loads and flexural moments. Studying the force flow mechanism for each load case, tab insertion angle (45°, 60°, and 90°) and fiber orientation (parallel and perpendicular to the load direction) are recognized as the key design parameters. A total of 22 specimens, each with minimum five replicates, are designed and tested. The structural performance of the joints is evaluated in both qualitative (i.e. damage propagation) and quantitative (i.e. strength, stiffness, and ductility) terms. Overall, small differences are observed between the yield and maximum strengths, indicating that the timber joints cannot demonstrate post-yield nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, the joints are classified as having low ductility. Moreover, changing the fiber orientation from parallel to perpendicular have a significant influence on the failure mode and damage propagation. Given that detailed (refined) numerical models (i.e. Finite Element (FE) continuum models with shell or brick elements) are typically computationally expensive and require advanced expertise, a novel macroscopic model, which is based on employing only beam and spring elements, is introduced. The kinematic degrees of freedom and force flow mechanism of IATP components are studied, associated equilibrium equations are formulated, and the macro model is proposed. FE continuum models using shell elements, as well as the results from recent experiments performed on full scale prototypes, are used to verify the proposed model. The comparative assessment shows that the response of the macro model is closely in line with the experiments and FE models. Despite its simplicity, the macro model is robust, and relative to the FE models, the computational time is considerably reduced. To harness CAE to integrate architectural and engineering knowledge, a new methodology is introduced to automate the process of receiving the 3D CAD geometry of a custom-defined IATP structure and converting it to the corresponding CAE macro model. The proposed CAD-to-CAE modular data exchange framework generates the components of the macro model, assigns a unique tag to each component while incorporating geometrical information and structural parameters in the modeling process. The framework, which is primary written using Python programming, is applied to a prefabricated timber beam with standard geometry, and a free-form IATP arch. It is concluded that the modular framework considerably reduces the time required for converting thousands of CAD assemblies to CAE macro models and can be used by practitioners},

Our investigation focuses on the assembly of cross-laminated wood veneer plates, where previous studies have shown that the strength of through-tenons is equivalent or superior to state-of-the-art fasteners such as screws or nails. This mechanical behaviour is highly dependent on a precise fit of the joints, where no gaps are left between the parts. However, the manual assembly of such tight-fitting joints can be complicated. Thanks to its rectangular cross-section, a single through-tenon joint is a sufficient assembly guide for an entire plate, but multiple through-tenons are required to establish a mechanically strong connection.},

  abstract = {The digitization of timber construction, the emergence of engineered wood products, and the urgent need to drastically reduce buildings' environmental impact have given a rebirth to wood as a construction material. On the one hand, increasing the use of timber in building technology has the potential to transform cities into carbon sinks. On the other hand, the growing availability of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and industrial robotic arms makes woodworking less labor-intensive, less time-consuming, and thus more cost-effective. Besides, recent advances in Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) have paved the way for a wide range of architectural and structural design possibilities by overcoming this organic material's inherent limitations. It is within this context that a significant focus has been put on Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structures (IATPS) at the Laboratory for Timber Constructions (IBOIS, EPFL) since the last decade. This innovative yet sustainable construction system combines traditional craft with state-of-the-art technology. Timber panels are cut with a CNC and connected with timber joints inspired by ancient woodworking techniques to create spatial structures that can reach up to 50 m without glue or screws. A significant asset lies in the possibility of building both standard and bespoke buildings from simple flat-packed panels whose pre-cut shape informs the assembly. While previous research has focused on the computational design and digital fabrication of IATPS, this thesis has, for the first time, investigated the automation of the assembly process. The objective was to determine the feasibility of assembling these structures with a robotic arm and to identify the influence of assembly constraints on the design. The methodology adopted a multidisciplinary approach integrating architectural, civil engineering, robotics, and computer science considerations. First, a computational framework was developed to enable a streamlined workflow from architectural design to robotic construction. This included the parametrization of timber joints, the implementation of algorithms to address modular assembly sequences, and a collaboration with an industrial partner to simulate robot trajectories within the design interface. Second, full-scale experiments were carried out with a 6-axis industrial robotic arm to assess and tackle the challenges associated with the robotic insertion of timber panels. A feedback loop relying on computer vision was developed to improve the robot's accuracy. In addition, design guidelines were established to determine an optimal shape for timber joints to reduce friction forces during insertion. A key achievement of the thesis is to have made IATPS more accessible to the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) community through the release of Manis, an open-source Grasshopper plugin. This integrated design tool automates the 3D modeling of timber joints, the generation of CNC cutting files and robot instructions, as well as the creation of Finite Element meshes for subsequent structural analysis. Furthermore, the thesis gives new perspectives on mass timber construction by providing a framework for the industrial implementation of wood-wood connections in automated prefabrication lines. It proposes an innovative assembly process that requires no mechanical fasteners or chemical bonding and is fully automated from design to construction},

Starting in the 1980s and accelerating in the 1990s, a first wave of automation and computerisation of fabrication unfolded within the manufacturing industry with the advent of computer numerically controlled machinery. The conversation about the state of the digitalisation of design and manufacturing is framed on the one hand by a retrospection of the technology-driven changes in building practice, and on the other by a speculation about possible future developments in the field. Hybrid construction approaches are perceived as a growing trend that has the potential to expand the share of timber construction into areas that are dominated by steel and concrete.},

It consists of multiple modules, which extend the capabilities of the conventional robot setup and fundamentally improve its usability and efficiency, since the user can easily set up, execute, and monitor the manufacturing tasks in a universal reference frame. To increase the performance of closed-loop control of the end-effector pose, a sensor fusion algorithm is implemented for fusing the data of the tracking system iGPS with an IMU. Experiments are carried out, which show a reduction of the average error down to 0.10 mm for the static correction, a significant increase of the measurement quality of the tracking system with the sensor fusion, and a path error below 0.5 mm for the dynamic correction. The presented correction system enables new applications in digital building construction, which require high accuracy target poses spread throughout a large workspace of cooperating robots.},

This approach is sufficient as long as the accuracy of the robot and the calibration of the workcell is good enough.

Using force control is one way to handle these difficulties. This paper presents a method of doing force control without a force sensor. The method is based on detuning of the low-level joint control loops, and the force is estimated from the control error. It is experimentally verified in a small part assembly task with a kinematically redundant robotic manipulator.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the computational process of generating and constructing interlocking frames. Its outcome delivers a sophisticated software tool that creates a three dimensional interlocking pattern, analyzes the intersecting conditions between members, and immediately provides instruction of its assembly sequence in animated visualization. An interlocking frame is a system that consists of short members spanning on a large surface where members lock each other at their mid-spans by simple notches. Such a system should be designed with consideration of its assembly sequence, as a static interlocking form may be described but impossible to assemble in any sequence. Given a three dimensional digital model of an interlocking frame, the feasibility of the disassembly sequence can be assessed by analyzing the geometric contact constraints between each member. The assembly sequence can then be obtained by reversing the disassembly sequence, and helps a designer to evaluate different options in the earlier stage of design. The proposed tool uses the genetic algorithm and graph searching algorithms to find optimized notching configurations that guarantee an assembly sequence. It can analyze various types of assemblies defined by planar surface contact constraints, and has a potential for further development into a versatile, automated 4D simulation tool.},

However, conventional layer-based AM also produces parts with inconsistent structural strength - thereby limiting AM's end-use applications. Expanding on robotics-enabled AM techniques addressing this limitation, a novel design-fabrication framework for producing structurally optimised lattices is presented here. Lattices are geometrically morphed to maximise their structural stiffness-to-weight ratio while respecting fabrication constraints imposed by the robotic printing process, and converted into tool-paths for PLA extrusion with a custom-built end effector mounted on an industrial robot arm. The printing process leverages thermal imaging for calibration, and develops a novel joint detail to increase the reliability and load-transfer capabilities of the print. Together, these techniques and methods - validated through comparative structural load testing - show promise for architecture-scale AM that combines structurally driven geometry with complexity-agnostic materialisation in new and exciting ways.},

  abstract = {Additive manufacturing allows using naturally grown structural elements in combination with 3D printed components, aiming to foster a more sustainable building culture. However, from a structural perspective, the combined use of natural and artificial materials introduces new uncertainties and challenges in relation to the design and analysis of the global load-bearing behavior of structures, as well as their connection systems. In this context, equilibrium-based methods derived from the lower bound theorem of the theory of plasticity are particularly effective since they are not restricted to a specific structural typology, material, or scale. This paper illustrates the application of equilibrium-based methods such as strut-and-tie modeling and graphic statics to the structural design and analysis of a fullscale demonstrator, the Digital Bamboo pavilion. The load-bearing system of the pavilion is a bamboo space frame reinforced by post-tensioned cables. The bamboo elements are connected via bespoke 3D printed nylon and steel connections. Thanks to the combination of natural and artificial materials, the Digital Bamboo exhibits a filigree high-performance geometry that goes beyond the ordinary space frame architecture.},

  abstract = {Timber construction is one of the most prevalent methods of constructing buildings in North America and an increasingly significant method of construction in Europe and the rest of the world. Timber Engineering deals not only with the structural aspects of timber construction, structural components, joints and systems based on solid timber and engineered wood products, but also material behaviour and properties on a wood element level. Produced by internationally renowned experts in the field, this book represents the state of the art in research on the understanding of the material behaviour of solid wood and engineered wood products. There is no comparable compendium currently available on the topic - the subjects represented include the most recent phenomena of timber engineering and the newest development of practice-related research. Grouped into three different sections, 'Basic properties of wood-based structural elements', 'Design aspects on timber structures' and 'Joints and structural assemblies', this book focuses on key issues in the understanding of:  timber as a modern engineered construction material with controlled and documented properties the background for design of structural systems based on timber and engineered wood products the background for structural design of joints in structural timber systems  Furthermore, this invaluable book contains advanced teaching material for all technical schools and universities involved in timber engineering. It also provides an essential resource for timber engineering students and researchers, as well as practicing structural and civil engineers.},

The project combines the fabrication and the spatial assembly of timber beams into one fully integrated robotic fabrication process. A cooperative robotic construction procedure that minimises the need for scaffolding and allows for the informed assembly of spatial structures with non-planar geometries was developed. This required the examination of suitable timber joining methods, assembly sequencing, as well developing appropriate and novel strategies to register and handle material deviations and construction tolerances. The physical implementation of the research in multiple experiments and finally, a full-scale building project validates the approach.},

Based on the author's on-site observations of over 50 roofs, four types of joint are described and analysed: (1) timber-to-timber joints, (2) nailed and bolted layers of timbers, (3) iron straps, stirrups and plates, and (4) connections between timber and iron members. Thus, this study intends to help researchers and heritage specialists to better interpret connection details during investigations of nineteenth-and early twentieth-century timber roofs.},

  abstract = {Currently, the Swiss timber industry in mountain areas largely exports unprocessed lumber and imports finished timber products due to the lack of digital tools. By using new digital design-to-production workflows, it is possible to investigate new building systems for small-scale structures using local timber for local applications. While automation in raw wood fabrication is a well-studied field, there is a lack of integration into the local timber industry. In addition, a few large robotic companies focus on raw-sawn-timber fabrication, leading to the high-level automation in fabrication but do not offer any architectural design methods. Architect and fabricator, in the raw wood context, are seen as two different parties. Research in architectural digital manufacturing demonstrate the potential in design with raw timber without the dependence on the large centralized timber companies. Often the focus is given to single case studies without questioning the automation in the local circular economies resulting in the small-scale semi-automated fab-lab workshops. Consequently, it is necessary to revisit individual design-to-fabrication workflows for whole timber structures and propose new open-source, extendable and reusable techniques.  First, a joinery algorithm is proposed to ease the drafting process of pair-wise wood-wood connections. The idea of the joinery algorithm is based on a design modelling separation into two independent algorithms: a) global architectural design, and b) local automation of wood-wood connections. These are the principal design requirements for the algorithm: a) re-usability of joinery methods for more than one case study, b) joinery library, c) automatic wood-wood connection generation, d) ensuring fabrication constraints e) propose a fast collision-based graph method, f) integrate joinery algorithm into a common CAD modelling environment, and g) employ minimal models for fast computation. Second, the geometrical irregularities of raw wood require laser-scanning and robotic integration. The Scanning part proposes novel solutions for raw wood fabrication: a) point-cloud processing, b) market-less alignment within a robotic setup, and c) calibration guidelines for laser scanners. The robotic section proposes a tool-path planning algorithm to shorten the fabrication file preparation. The design recommendations for machining setups are given to ensure secure, stable and accurate fabrication. Third, timber joinery prototypes are assembled to validate the proposed workflow. Three types are developed: segmented timber shells, Nexorades and a truss from tree forks. Additionally, the modelling framework is interconnected with tool-path planning to manifest the validity of fabrication concerning a joint geometry. Finally, the developed algorithms are open-sourced. In conclusion, the design-to-fabrication workflow proves that it is possible to detect wood joinery types based on minimal CAD models. From a user perspective, these models do not require hard-coded parametric skills and, as a result, applicable to CAD modelling interfaces. Finally, the integration of the low resolution referencing system of the laser scanner and the industrial robotic arm into the joinery generation method verifies the link between architectural design and manufacturing processes},

  abstract = {This paper presents a digital joinery generation method for whole-timber structures using wood-wood connections. The research is based on a collaboration with a local timber company located in a mountain area [1]. In this context, there is a need to explore available round-wood stock to increase its use and apply it to the local construction. The inspiration is taken from joinery generation methods [2,3] and applied to round-wood timber assemblies. The joinery solver considers: available stock of timber, its natural characteristics (i.e. irregularity in section, length, curvature, forking), low-poly digital representation and digital fabrication (CNC, Robot tool-path). First, round-wood is scanned and point-clouds are processed to get the central-axis and radii. Second, trunks are oriented to a design space. Third, the joinery solver creates connections. This method is based on a tiling process when a group of polylines are scaled, sheared and translated to a connection zone. The joinery library is collected from existing literature and classified i.e. side-side, side-end, end-end types. The research shows that it is possible to automate joinery generation while examining variability of timber and digital fabrication constraints. The joinery solver is validated by physical tests using 4.5 CNC and 6-axis ABB robot},

Designing assemblies is a non-trivial task as a slight local modification on a part’s geometry or its joining method could have a global impact on the structural and/or functional performance of the whole assembly. Assemblies can be classified as structures that transmit force to carry loads and mechanisms that transfer motion and force to perform mechanical work. In this state-of-the-art report, we focus on computational design of structures with rigid parts, which generally can be formulated as a geometric modeling and optimization problem. We broadly classify existing computational design approaches, mainly from the computer graphics community, according to high-level design objectives, including fabricability, structural stability, reconfigurability, and tileability. Computational analysis of various aspects of assemblies is an integral component in these design approaches. We review different classes of computational analysis and design methods, discuss their strengths and limitations, make connections among them, and propose possible directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Industrial robots (IRs) are promising options for machining large complex structural parts due to the higher flexibility, larger operating space, and lower cost compared with multi-axis machine tools. However, the relatively low posture-dependent stiffness and large stiffness deformation of IRs significantly deteriorate the contour accuracy of milling in which the cutting force is large generally. It is very complex to achieve a precise stiffness model and predict stiffness deformation of IRs because of the joint clearance, drift of zero-position, and other nonlinear factors. The conventional stiffness model of IRs only takes each joint as a constant linear torsion spring into consideration and ignores other difficult-to-model factors, which leads to low-accuracy identified results and thereafter induces deformation prediction errors. The data-driven approach can be used to obtain an accurate stiffness and deformation model, but a large amount of experimental data is required and it will cost enormous time and effort. In order to circumvent the experimental data deficiency and difficult-to-model issue, a simulation-driven transfer learning method named Adaptive Domain Adversarial Neural Network with Dual-Regressions (ADANN-2R) is designed for robot deformation prediction. Amounts of coarse deformation data, which are generated by the conventional stiffness model, are regarded as source data. And few real deformation data, which are obtained by deformation experiments, are regarded as target data. The Dual-Regressions are designed after the feature extractor, and the weighting parameters are adjusted adaptively to tackle the different magnitude of the regression loss and domain discrimination loss. The ADANN-2R aligns the simulated source data and real target data to perform adversarial training, and an accurate target deformation predictor is achieved. Experimental results indicate that the proposed ADANN-2R can obtain high-accuracy prediction with few real data compared with the conventional stiffness model. Compared with the path without deformation compensation and the pre-compensated path using the conventional stiffness model, the maximum position error of the pre-compensated path using the proposed ADANN-2R is reduced by 78.12\% and 32.45\%, respectively.},

The timber architecture which has ensued over the past centuries reveals to the modern observer the depth of knowledge which has enabled both Eastern and Western cultures to use this material in such a creative way. In the most typical method of building with wood, elements are connected by using wood joints which do not require the assistance of adhesives or metal connectors. This art of wood joining reached its zenith in Japan; but Europe too provided its share of highly influential forms. By looking at several hundred examples from Japan and 18 European countries, this book describes in great detail the history of timber architecture in terms of its technical, aesthetic and ecological dimensions.
